# Example Site

## Local Dev

To develop `content` locally, just run the normal `hugo` command. A `package.json` file is also provided which has three pre-configured `npm scripts` offering enhanced local development:

```shell
# dev build and server with watch
npm run srv
# dev build only
npm run dev
# prd build only
npm run prd
```

To develop the Theme's internal `css` or `js`, see the `npm scripts` in the root `package.json` file.
