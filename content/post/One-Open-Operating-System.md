Current operating system (IOS,Android,Windows,Mac) is not exactly what I want,so I decide to rebuild another operating system.

I call it **One Open Operating System**.

I split this final goal into some executable steps.

## App

![image](/image/post/One-Open-Operating-System/1-Call-Taxi.png)

Current App is Offline front-end + web service.

But I think an ideal App is a **cloud function**. We don't need to download it,it always runs on the cloud as some kind of serverless service.

Wechat micro App is an example but I think it is not simple enough.

For example,calling Taxi is a cloud function like this:

```go
func CallTaxi(myPosition,destination FourDimensionalVector){
    return Taxi{}
}

```

Calling Taxi is exactly a **edge computing** behavior--After telling the cloud my position and my destination,the Taxi scheduler will let the nearest Taxi to me do the  other "computing"（Take me home）.

## Electronic Device

After putting **edge computing** onto the cloud,we can work on the next generation of the electronic device(currently we call them cellphone/IPAD/computer/laptop).

In my option,the electronic device is just a "**display layer**" and a collection of sensors.We use our mind or voice to control the electronic device.The CPU,RAM is useless.And I would call ROM as the "backup" of the cloud data.

I would like to say,the key of the electronic device is AI.And I think [AI is an open intelligent API gateway](http://www.bullshitprogram.com/the-seed-of-robot/).

Finally,the electronic device will became a superb AI like Roman EXE.He will help us do some "**daily computing jobs**".

The "云影" system is an example. By 5G,everything is possible.

## Kubernetes

I think Kubernetes is just a **middle distributed system**.There are so many ugly design and unsolved problems in Kubernetes.Such like volume(it is actually a distributed storage problem),network diagnosis,StatefulSet,CronJob and so on.

Just like [Lei Zhang](https://github.com/resouer) said,Kubernetes is just a database.What the most important is paradigms,I call them **cloud native application paradigms**.

Them include
1. Observability
1. Self-healing
1. Fallibility
1. Debuggable

Kubernetes's effect is to **build up a cloud native application standard**.

## IaaS

![image](/image/post/One-Open-Operating-System/5-IAAS.png)

First of all,we need to declare one thing: **IaaS is a super distributed system** which includes so many products.

I think in the near future,IaaS will become a super **Cloud Native Application Store**.

In developer's view,we may need database,redis,distributed message queue and so on.

Take Tencent Cloud as an example.A better DevOps pipeline would be like this:

1. Tencent Cloud administrator creates a sub user(Currently we call it user access key);
2. The project manager
 sets up the [CAM](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/17848) according to actual condition;
3. The R&D (Research and Development) engineer writes business code;
4. The DevOps engineer helps the R&D engineer to make the code running on the Tencent Cloud(Such as preparing the test/product environment,docker build,configuration,logging,monitor).

![image](/image/post/One-Open-Operating-System/6-sidecar-container-call-product.png)

Look at the picture above,then you will find that the business code would be simply like this:

```go
client := ServiceMeshClient{}
iaas := client.UseTencentCloud()
redis := iaas.Redis()
setRedisResult := redis.Put("Zeusro","是一个靓仔")
```

**Just forget the configuration**,let the DevOps engineer do that job.That is not the R&D (Research and Development) engineer's business any more.

The configuration(region,access key and access secret) is "gone".It is generated by the configuration controller,and hidden inside the sidecar container.

In R&D engineer's view,**zero configuration** is so cool,don't you think so?

## Next Generation Digital Life

Let's come back to the first question: Calling Taxi.

![image](/image/post/One-Open-Operating-System/7-Next-Generation-Digital-Life.png)

In the next generation digital world,the process of taking Taxi would be like this:

1. Zeusro: Hi,Roman,take me home.
1. Roman: OK,wait for a second(get your position and home's position).
1. Roman: Here are some available service like Amap Taxi,DiDi Taxi,
Meituan Taxi on the service discovery system（dubbo 3.0, social advertising system).Please make your choice.
5. Zeusro: Amap Taxi.
6. Roman: OK.
7. Taxi driver: Don't BB.Just get in the car.
